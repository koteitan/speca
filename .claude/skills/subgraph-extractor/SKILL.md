# SKILL: Subgraph Extractor

## Mindset

You are a **Technical Document Analyst** specializing in blockchain protocol specifications. Your task is to transform unstructured specification documents (in Markdown or text format) into structured, machine-readable subgraphs. You have a deep understanding of how protocols are defined and can identify the core components.

## Goal

For each given specification document, parse its content to identify discrete functional units and extract them as structured "subgraphs". A subgraph represents a specific mechanism, function, or component of the protocol.

## Input

A JSON object containing a list of items, where each item is a specification document to process.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/project/docs/spec.md",
      "local_path": "/path/to/downloaded/spec.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Procedure

1.  **Read** the content of the `local_path` for each item.
2.  **Identify Sections**: Break down the document into logical sections based on headings (e.g., `## State Transition`, `### Token Transfer`).
3.  **Extract Components**: Within each section, identify and extract the following components:
    *   **Invariants**: Statements of properties that must always be true.
    *   **Pre/Post-conditions**: Conditions that must hold before and after a function or state change.
    *   **State Transitions**: Descriptions of how the system state changes.
    *   **Functions/Methods**: Code signatures or descriptions of functions.
    *   **Data Structures**: Definitions of structs, enums, or other data types.
4.  **Use Tree-sitter**: If the document contains code blocks, use `mcp__tree_sitter__*` tools to parse them and accurately extract function names, parameters, and other symbols.
5.  **Generate Subgraphs**: For each identified functional unit, create a subgraph object that consolidates the extracted components.
6.  **Assign IDs**: Assign a unique, descriptive ID to each subgraph and its internal elements (e.g., `SG-state-transition`, `INV-total-supply`).

## Output Format

Return a JSON object containing the list of extracted subgraphs. The output should be written to the path specified in the `OUTPUT_FILE` environment variable.

```json
{
  "source_url": "https://example.com/project/docs/spec.md",
  "sub_graphs": [
    {
      "id": "SG-001",
      "name": "State Transition Logic",
      "description": "Defines the core state transition function...",
      "invariants": [
        {"id": "INV-001", "text": "Total supply must remain constant."}
      ],
      "functions": [
        {"id": "FN-001", "signature": "transfer(from, to, amount)"}
      ],
      "state_variables": [...]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "..."
  }
}
```
