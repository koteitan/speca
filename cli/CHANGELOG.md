# Changelog

All notable changes to `speca-cli` are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Accumulated changes since v0.9.0. Will graduate to a tagged release once the
0.9.x soak window produces meaningful feedback.

### Added

- **`speca run` pre-flight checks** ([#28]):
  - `auth-expired` — refuses to spawn when the active OAuth token is past
    its `expires_at`. API-key accounts and missing auth files are
    untouched.
  - `stale-resume` — refuses to spawn (without `--force`) when
    `outputs/TARGET_INFO.json` was rewritten meaningfully later than the
    newest `outputs/01b_PARTIAL_*.json`. 60-second grace window absorbs
    back-to-back `init` + `run`.
- **`speca browse` schema-mismatch gate** ([#28]) — exits with a
  parseable `[ERROR kind=schema-mismatch] …` line when every matched
  partial file fails loader validation, instead of dropping into a
  zero-row TUI.
- **`subprocess-crash` reporter** ([#28]) — `speca run`'s spawn-error
  handler now uses the canonical kind=subprocess-crash format on both
  headless and TUI paths.
- **`KNOWN_VERDICTS` const tuple** in `cli/src/lib/findings/types.ts` so
  call sites that hand-write a verdict literal can opt into the closed
  set via `KnownVerdict` (a typo'd verdict fails to compile).
- **`warnUnknownPhases` heads-up** in `speca run` — warns to stderr when
  `--phase` / `--target` carry an id outside `KNOWN_PHASE_IDS`. Forks
  may legitimately add phases via custom orchestrator configs, so the
  unknown id is forwarded; the warn just removes the surprise factor.
- **`cli/src/lib/errors/report.ts`** — stderr-side reporter that mirrors
  `<ErrorModal>` wording, with a parseable `kind=<kind>` token so CI
  scripts can match specific failure modes.
- **Post-publish smoke job** in `.github/workflows/release.yml` —
  spins up a clean ubuntu runner after every successful `npm publish`,
  installs the freshly-published version, and runs
  `speca version` / `speca help` / `speca doctor` plus an `npx` route
  check. Catches tarball / bin-shim / dependency-pinning regressions
  the in-tree tests can't see.
- **Git-build install path** in `cli/README.md` and root `README.md` —
  the npm route stays the recommended one, but contributors testing
  unreleased branches now have a documented `git clone && npm install
  && npm run build` recipe (plus `npm link`).

### Fixed

- All seven `ErrorKind`s defined in `cli/src/lib/errors/kinds.ts` now
  have at least one production caller. Before this release four kinds
  (auth-expired / schema-mismatch / stale-resume / subprocess-crash)
  had infrastructure but no code path firing them.

### Changed

- `speca version` / version-string mentions in docs now reflect the
  shipped `0.9.0` (was stale `1.0.0` / `M2`-era text in the root
  README).

### Tests

- +32 vitest cases (256 → 288): errors-reporter (×13), preflight
  detectors (×10), browse error-kinds (×2), run pre-flight + phase warn
  (×5), verdict closed-set (×2).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-07

Soft-launch release ahead of the v1.0.0 GA. All features from the M1–M7
milestones in [`docs/SPECA_CLI_SPEC.md`](../docs/SPECA_CLI_SPEC.md) §11
are included; the 0.9.0 version reserves the npm package name and
exercises the tag-driven release pipeline before we commit to v1.0.0
stability guarantees.

### Added

#### Core commands
- `speca version` — print speca-cli version
- `speca doctor` — diagnose Node / uv / git / claude-code / OAuth scope readiness
- `speca auth login` — paste-code OAuth flow against Anthropic Claude Code
- `speca auth login --api-key <key>` — fallback for users without a Claude Code subscription
- `speca auth status` — list saved accounts with token expiry
- `speca init` — `@clack/prompts` wizard that writes valid `TARGET_INFO.json` and `BUG_BOUNTY_SCOPE.json` (validated against the Pydantic-derived JSON Schemas)
- `speca run` — TUI dashboard that drives `scripts/run_phase.py --json`, with phase rows, worker badges, log pane, budget gauge, and budget-exceeded modal
- `speca browse` — finding browser with severity-coloured table, filter DSL (`severity:`, `verdict:`, `prop:`, `repo:`, `text:`, AND/OR/NOT, wildcards), sort, and code peek with syntax highlighting
- `speca ask` — chat with Claude about a finding via `claude --output-format stream-json --resume`, with 50KB context cap and project-local session persistence

#### Infrastructure
- Vendored `ex-machina-co/opencode-anthropic-auth` (MIT) for OAuth — see `docs/VENDOR.md`
- Cross-platform token store at `~/.config/speca/auth.json` (Windows: `%APPDATA%\speca\auth.json`), atomic write, chmod 0600 on POSIX
- NDJSON pipeline event emitter (`scripts/orchestrator/json_events.py`) with 7 event types
- JSON Schema export from Pydantic (`scripts/export_schemas.py`) bundled into the npm package
- Theme system (dark / light / solarized) loadable from `~/.config/speca/config.toml`
- Keybind override system via the same `config.toml`
- Generic `<ErrorModal>` covering SPEC §10.4's seven failure modes
- Common `--no-tui` and `--json` output-mode helpers (`getOutputMode`, `printNoTui`, `emitJson`)

#### Documentation
- `cli/README.md` (~350 lines) — end-user guide
- `docs/hiro/cli-quickstart.md` — Japanese quickstart for hirorogo team
- `cli/asciinema/README.md` — recording recipe for the demo cast
- `cli/docs/VENDOR.md` — vendored-code provenance tracker

### Tests
- 220 vitest cases across 24 files, all green on the matrix (ubuntu-22.04 / macOS 14 / windows-2022 × Node 20 / 22)

### Deferred to v1.1+
- Wiring the M6 polish infrastructure (theme, keybinds, ErrorModal, output-mode helpers) into the M3/M4/M5 subcommand renderers — the infrastructure ships standalone in v1.0; subcommand integration follows in v1.1
- `speca attach` (read-only attach to a running pipeline)
- Multi-finding chat context for `speca ask`
- Asciinema-recorded README demo cast (recording recipe shipped, asset to be uploaded post-release)
- Headless "start now, attach later" pipeline mode
