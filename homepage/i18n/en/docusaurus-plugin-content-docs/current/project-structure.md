## Roles of major directories

**`scripts/orchestrator/`**  
The core of the pipeline. `config.py` defines the configuration of each Phase, and `base.py` manages batch generation, parallel execution, and resume. `runner.py` invokes the Claude Code CLI, and `watchdog.py` monitors cost.

**`prompts/`**  
Contains the Claude prompts for each Phase. Phases 01a and 01b are defined as skills (`SKILL.md`); the remaining Phases inline the worker prompts directly. Reading the prompts shows what each Phase is analyzing and how.

**`cli/`**  
The TUI frontend that provides the `speca init` / `speca run` / `speca browse` and other commands. The entry point is `cli/src/cli.tsx`. Implemented in Node.js + Ink.

**`tests/`**  
Automated tests that run with pytest. They run as a CI pre-flight check before every Phase. Run with `uv run python3 -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`.

**`outputs/`**  
Holds pipeline input files (`TARGET_INFO.json`, `BUG_BOUNTY_SCOPE.json`) and the outputs of each Phase (`{phase}_PARTIAL_*.json`). Listed in `.gitignore`, so audit results never leak into the repository.

**`automation/`**  
GitHub Actions workflow definitions. CI jobs are split per Phase, allowing each Phase to be re-executed independently.

## Where to start reading the code

If you want to grasp the overall pipeline flow, start from `scripts/run_phase.py`. The flow is: argument parsing → `PhaseConfig` selection → `BaseOrchestrator.run()`.

If you want to investigate the CLI behavior, the entry point is `cli/src/cli.tsx`.

The concrete analysis logic for each Phase is written in the corresponding prompt under `prompts/`. Phases 01e, 02c, 03, and 04 inline all logic into the prompt.

Background and rationale of design decisions are summarized in [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/NyxFoundation/speca/blob/main/CLAUDE.md).
