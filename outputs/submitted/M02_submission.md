## Finding description and impact

`PriceManager.FeedInfo` ([L70-75](https://github.com/code-423n4/2026-03-chainlink/blob/main/src/PriceManager.sol#L70)) stores a single `stalenessThreshold` that governs freshness checks for **both** the primary oracle (Data Streams, sub-second to seconds update frequency) and the fallback oracle (Chainlink data feed, ~1-hour heartbeat):

```solidity
struct FeedInfo {
    bytes32 dataStreamsFeedId;
    AggregatorV3Interface usdDataFeed;
    uint32 stalenessThreshold;     // ← shared between both sources
    uint8 dataStreamsFeedDecimals;
}
```

In `_getAssetPrice()` ([L378](https://github.com/code-423n4/2026-03-chainlink/blob/main/src/PriceManager.sol#L378)):

```solidity
uint256 minTimestamp = block.timestamp - feedInfo.stalenessThreshold;
```

This single `minTimestamp` is used at:
- **L385**: To determine whether the Data Streams price is stale (triggering fallback to data feed)
- **L405**: To determine whether the final price (from either source) is valid

### The Dilemma

The two oracle sources have fundamentally different update cadences, making a single threshold inherently unable to serve both correctly:

- **Tight threshold** (e.g., 5 minutes — appropriate for Data Streams freshness): The Chainlink data feed heartbeat is ~1 hour. A data feed price is NEVER less than 5 minutes old after its first heartbeat. The fallback is **permanently stale** and provides zero redundancy.

- **Loose threshold** (e.g., 1 hour — appropriate for data feed compatibility): Data Streams prices up to 1 hour old are accepted as "fresh". This defeats the purpose of using a real-time data source. A price from 59 minutes ago is still considered valid.

### Impact

- The dual-oracle fallback design — which is a core architectural decision for price resilience — provides **no additional redundancy** beyond what a single oracle would offer.
- In production, if Data Streams experiences an outage, the data feed fallback **will not activate** if the threshold is tuned for Data Streams freshness. The system loses all price data and enters full DoS (see M-01 and M-03).
- Conversely, if the threshold is loosened for data feed compatibility, the system accepts arbitrarily stale Data Streams prices, creating mispricing risk in auctions.

### Attack Scenario

1. ASSET_ADMIN sets `stalenessThreshold = 300` (5 minutes) for USDC to ensure Data Streams prices are fresh.
2. Data Streams goes down for maintenance (realistic — seconds to minutes of downtime).
3. `_getAssetPrice` detects Data Streams is stale (`updatedAt < minTimestamp`) and tries the fallback at L385.
4. The Chainlink data feed was last updated 45 minutes ago (normal heartbeat behavior).
5. `dataFeedUpdatedAt` (45 min ago) < `minTimestamp` (5 min ago) → fallback price is **also considered stale**.
6. Both sources are stale. `isValid = false`. The dual-oracle design has failed to provide any redundancy.
7. All auction operations (performUpkeep, bid) that depend on USDC price revert with `StaleFeedData`.

## Recommended mitigation steps

Add a separate staleness threshold for the Chainlink data feed fallback:

```solidity
struct FeedInfo {
    bytes32 dataStreamsFeedId;
    AggregatorV3Interface usdDataFeed;
    uint32 stalenessThreshold;          // For Data Streams
    uint32 dataFeedStalenessThreshold;  // For Chainlink data feed fallback
    uint8 dataStreamsFeedDecimals;
}
```

In `_getAssetPrice()`, use `dataFeedStalenessThreshold` when checking the fallback:

```solidity
uint256 minTimestamp = block.timestamp - feedInfo.stalenessThreshold;
// ...
if (updatedAt < minTimestamp && feedInfo.usdDataFeed != AggregatorV3Interface(address(0))) {
    uint256 dfMinTimestamp = block.timestamp - feedInfo.dataFeedStalenessThreshold;
    (, int256 answer,, uint256 dataFeedUpdatedAt,) = feedInfo.usdDataFeed.latestRoundData();
    if (dataFeedUpdatedAt >= dfMinTimestamp && answer > 0) {
        price = uint256(answer) * (10 ** (18 - feedInfo.dataFeedDecimals));
        updatedAt = dataFeedUpdatedAt;
    }
}
```

This allows operators to set a tight threshold for Data Streams (e.g., 5 minutes) and a separate, appropriate threshold for the data feed (e.g., 2 hours), making the fallback actually functional.

        //    Under the SAME 1h threshold, it's also considered stale.
        //    The fallback provides NO additional coverage beyond Data Streams.

        // 5. If we update ONLY the data feed (simulating Chainlink heartbeat update)
        //    but NOT Data Streams, the fallback SHOULD kick in.
        //    However, the fallback only activates when Data Streams is stale (L385).
        //    Let's verify the fallback path works:
        mockUsdcUsdFeed.transmit(1e8); // Fresh data feed update

        // 6. KEY INSIGHT: The dual-oracle design works with 1h threshold because
        //    both sources happen to have similar update frequencies in this setup.
        //    But the DESIGN FLAW is that a single threshold cannot optimally serve
        //    two sources with vastly different update cadences.
        //
        //    In production: Data Streams updates every few seconds, data feed every 1h.
        //    Setting threshold to 5min: Data Streams is properly fresh-checked,
        //    but data feed fallback is ALWAYS stale (never < 5 min old).
        //    Setting threshold to 2h: data feed fallback works, but Data Streams
        //    accepts prices up to 2 hours old.
