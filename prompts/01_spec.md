Description: Decompose the project's technical documentation into a formal specification using the concept of Program Graphs. This includes identifying states, actions, and the transitions between them. The goal is to create a rigorous, machine-readable foundation for formal analysis and verification.
Usage: `/01_spec KEYWORDS=... SPEC_URLS=...`
Example: `/01_spec KEYWORDS="geth,ethereum client,EIP,blockchain" SPEC_URLS="https://example.com/spec,https://example.com/audit"`
Language: English only.
Execution hint: This is the first step. It provides the formal model for all subsequent analysis.

# **System Specification Generation Prompt**

**Goal**
Analyze the provided technical documentation and source code to model the system's behavior as a **Program Graph**. A Program Graph consists of nodes (representing program states) and directed edges (representing state transitions). This formal representation is the foundation for rigorous security analysis.

**Output (required file):** `outputs/01_SPEC.json`

## 0) Research & Context Gathering

Before beginning the extraction tasks, you must gather the necessary context:

1.  **Keyword Research:** Use the `web_search` tool to investigate the provided `KEYWORDS`. Understand the domain, terminology, and key concepts related to the system.
2.  **Specification Retrieval:** If `SPEC_URLS` are provided, use `read_url_content` (or similar tools) to read the content of these URLs. **Crucially, if a URL points to a documentation index, table of contents, or landing page, you MUST recursively visit relevant sub-links.** Do not stop at the top-level page. You are responsible for ensuring comprehensive coverage of the specification by following links that are relevant to the `KEYWORDS` or the system's core functionality.
3.  **Context Integration:** Use the information gathered from your research and the provided specifications to inform your modeling in the following steps. Ensure your Program Graph accurately reflects the authoritative specifications.

## 1) Core Extraction Tasks: Modeling as a Program Graph

Your primary task is to translate the system's user flows and processes into a formal graph structure.

### **Task 1.1: Define Graph Nodes (`program_graph.nodes`)**

*   **Definition:** A node represents a discrete, observable state in the system or a specific computational action.
*   **Action:** For each state or action, create a node object with:
    *   `id`: A stable, unique identifier for the node (e.g., `STATE-WAITING-FOR-RPC`, `ACTION-VALIDATE-JWT`).
    *   `label`: A concise, human-readable description of the state or action.
    *   `actor_id`: The ID of the actor responsible for this state or for performing this action (must match an ID from `trusted_entities`).
    *   `type`: Must be either `"State"` or `"Action"`.
    *   `sub_graph_id`: (Optional) If this action represents a complex process (like EVM execution), provide the ID of a sub-graph that models it in detail (e.g., `"GRAPH-EVM-EXECUTION"`).

### **Task 1.2: Define Graph Edges (`program_graph.edges`)**

*   **Definition:** A directed edge represents a transition from a source node to a target node.
*   **Action:** For each transition, create an edge object with:
    *   `id`: A stable, unique identifier for the edge (e.g., `EDGE-RPC-RECEIVED`).
    *   `source`: The `id` of the starting node of the transition.
    *   `target`: The `id` of the ending node of the transition.
    *   `label`: A description of the event or condition that triggers this transition (e.g., "RPC request received", "Validation successful").
    *   `data_involved`: An array of data structure IDs (from `data_structures`) that are passed or modified during this transition.

### **Task 1.3: Supporting Definitions**

*   **`trusted_entities`**: Identify all actors in the system.
*   **`data_structures`**: Identify all core data objects passed between states.

---

### **Task 1.4: Define Sub-Graphs (`sub_graphs`)**

*   **Goal:** Model complex logic that is abstracted away in the main graph (e.g., EVM execution details, specific EIP logic).
*   **Action:** If `sub_graph_id` was used in any node, define the corresponding sub-graph here.
    *   **Scope:** Specifically focus on logic relevant to the provided `KEYWORDS` or EIPs (e.g., `PUSH0`, `SELFDESTRUCT`).
    *   **Completeness Mandate:** You MUST broaden your scope to include **ALL** significant EIPs identified in the documentation that introduce new execution logic (e.g., new opcodes, precompiles, state changes).
    *   **Handling Constraints:** If you identify many EIPs (e.g., > 5) and cannot model them all in detail within this response due to length limits:
        1.  Start by modeling the top 3-5 most critical ones as full `sub_graphs`.
        2.  **CRITICAL:** List the remaining EIPs (IDs and brief titles) in a new top-level field `pending_sub_graphs` in the JSON output. This serves as a formal request for a follow-up analysis.
    *   **Structure:** Same as the main `program_graph` (nodes and edges).
    *   **Nodes:** Should represent low-level operations (e.g., `ACTION-EVM-DECODE-OPCODE`, `STATE-EVM-STACK-OVERFLOW`).
