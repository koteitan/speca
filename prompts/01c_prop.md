# **Security Property Catalog Generation Prompt**

**Goal**
From the Program Graph (`01_SPEC.json`) and Trust Model (`01b_TRUSTMODEL.json`), generate a catalog of formal security properties. Each property will be defined in terms of the graph's nodes and edges, and its reachability will be determined by analyzing paths through the graph.

**Output (required file):** `outputs/01c_PROP.json`

## 1) Inputs

1.  **System Specification (Authoritative):** `outputs/01_SPEC.json`
2.  **Trust Model (Authoritative):** `outputs/01b_TRUSTMODEL.json`

---

## 2) Property Generation & Analysis Logic

For each major behavior represented by a path in the program graph, generate one or more security properties.

**CRITICAL: Sub-Graph Analysis:** Your analysis must be recursive. After analyzing the main `program_graph`, you MUST iterate through each graph defined in the `sub_graphs` array and apply the exact same property generation and reachability analysis logic to the nodes and edges within each sub-graph.

### **Task 2.1: Generate Properties for Each Boundary Edge**

*   For **each and every** `boundary_edge` defined in the `TRUSTMODEL` input, you **MUST** generate at least one property.
*   The primary goal of this property is to formally state that the transition across this trust boundary is secure.
*   This task is **mandatory** and has the highest priority. Ensure 100% coverage.

### **Task 2.2: Define the Property in Terms of the Graph**

*   `property`: A formal statement about the graph. This can be an **invariance** (a property of a `node`/`state`) or a **transition property** (a property of an `edge`).
    *   *Invariant Example:* "The node `STATE-EL-REQUEST-VALIDATED` can only be reached if the path to it includes the edge `EDGE-VALIDATION-SUCCESS`."
    *   *Transition Example:* "The data `DATA-JWT-REQUEST` transferred across the edge `EDGE-CL-SENDS-REQUEST` must be cryptographically signed."
*   `anti_property`: The formal negation of the property.
    *   *Invariant Example:* "A path exists to `STATE-EL-REQUEST-VALIDATED` that does not include the edge `EDGE-VALIDATION-SUCCESS`."
    *   *Transition Example:* "An attacker can cause unsigned data to be transferred across the edge `EDGE-CL-SENDS-REQUEST`."

### **Task 2.3: Perform Formal Reachability Analysis**

This is the core formal analysis task.

**Reachability Analysis Algorithm:**
1.  **Identify Attacker Starting Nodes:** Create a set of all nodes where the `actor_id` corresponds to an `UNTRUSTED` or `SEMI_TRUSTED` actor.
2.  **Perform Graph Traversal:** Starting from these nodes, perform a graph traversal (e.g., Breadth-First Search) to find all reachable nodes. Store the path taken to reach each node.
3.  **Check Anti-Property:** For a given `anti_property` (e.g., reaching `STATE-X` without passing through `ACTION-VALIDATE`), check if `STATE-X` is in the set of reachable nodes.
4.  **Verify Path Conditions:** If `STATE-X` is reachable, examine the path. If the path does *not* contain the required validation node/edge (e.g., `ACTION-VALIDATE`), then the anti-property is `REACHABLE`.
5.  **Conclude Unreachability:** If all possible paths from attacker nodes to `STATE-X` are proven to pass through the required validation node, then the anti-property is `UNREACHABLE`.

**Justify the Analysis (`reachability_rationale`):** Provide a formal argument based on the graph structure. "The anti-property is unreachable because all paths from the untrusted node `STATE-CL-PREPARE-REQUEST` to the target `STATE-EL-REQUEST-VALIDATED` must pass through the `ACTION-EL-VALIDATE-JWT` node. The definition of this action node specifies it has two outgoing edges: `EDGE-VALIDATION-SUCCESS` and `EDGE-VALIDATION-FAILURE`. An invalid input provably leads to the `STATE-EL-REQUEST-REJECTED` node, making the target state unreachable for an attacker."

### **Task 2.4: Link to Graph Elements**

*   `graph_elements`: An array of `id`s for the nodes and edges from `01_SPEC.json` that are relevant to this property. This makes the property directly traceable to the formal model.
