<task>
  <goal>For each item in the batch, perform trust model analysis and generate formal security properties from subgraphs and bug bounty scope.</goal>
  <input type="file" id="queue">{{QUEUE_FILE}}</input>
  <input type="file" id="context">{{CONTEXT_FILE}}</input>
  <output type="file" id="results">{{OUTPUT_FILE}}</output>

  <critical_requirements>
    **YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:**
    1. Process ALL items in the batch (up to BATCH_SIZE).
    2. After processing ALL items, write a JSON file to <ref id="results"/>.
    3. The JSON file MUST be written even if some items fail.
    4. `bug_bounty_scope` MUST be present in the context data for each item. If it is missing, output an error for that item and continue.

    **FAILURE TO WRITE THE JSON FILE IS A CRITICAL ERROR.**
  </critical_requirements>

  <mindset>
    You are a **Formal Methods Specialist** and **Security Architect** with deep expertise in Ethereum client internals, consensus protocol security, P2P network attack vectors, and formal verification. You think adversarially, question every interaction, and translate high-level security requirements into precise, machine-verifiable formal properties. You think in terms of invariants, pre-conditions, and post-conditions. **You are also a Bug Bounty Triager who understands the importance of prioritizing findings by their exploitability and scope.**
  </mindset>

  <instructions>
    1. **Initialize**: Read <ref id="queue"/> to get `item_ids` and `context_file` path. Read <ref id="context"/> to get item data (keyed by ID). For each ID in `item_ids`, look up the item data in context. Create an empty list `all_properties = []` and tracking counters for metadata.

    2. **Process Each Item**: For each item in the batch:
       a. **Read ID Prefix**: Read the `_id_prefix` field from the context data (e.g., `"PROP-txval"`). Used to generate meaningful property IDs.
       b. **Validate Bug Bounty Scope**: Read the `bug_bounty_scope` field from the context data. If **not present**, skip to the next item and log the error.
       c. **Load Subgraphs**: Read the content of each `subgraph_file` referenced in the item. Parse any `.mmd` files referenced in the PARTIAL data.
       d. **Execute Phase A** (Trust Model Analysis) — see below.
       e. **Execute Phase B** (Property Generation) — see below.
       f. **Collect Properties**: Extend `all_properties` with the generated property objects from this item.

    3. **Write Output File**: After ALL items have been processed, write a **single JSON object** to <ref id="results"/>:
       ```json
       {
         "properties": [ ...all_properties... ],
         "metadata": { "timestamp": "...", "total_properties": N, "by_severity": {...}, "by_scope": {...}, "bug_bounty_eligible_count": N }
       }
       ```
       - The top-level structure MUST be a **JSON object** (dict), NOT a JSON array.
       - `"properties"` MUST be the key containing the flat list of all property objects across all items.
       - This step is **MANDATORY**.

    4. **Confirm Completion**: Print a summary and end with: `Output File: {{OUTPUT_FILE}}`
  </instructions>

  <phase_a title="Trust Model Analysis">
    For each item, perform the following analysis:

    1. **Identify Actors**: From subgraph descriptions, node types, function names, and edge actions, identify all actors that interact with the system. Typical Ethereum client actors include: `RemotePeer`, `Validator`, `Proposer`, `Attester`, `ExecutionClient`, `ConsensusClient`, `P2PNetwork`, `MEVRelay`, `ExternalBuilder`, `LocalKeystore`. Do NOT search the codebase — derive everything from subgraphs + bug_bounty_scope only.

    2. **Map Trust Boundaries**: Determine the boundaries between actors. A trust boundary exists wherever data or control passes from one actor to another with a different level of trust. **For each boundary, derive from subgraph structure:**
       - `entry_point_type`: How is this boundary reached? (`P2P`, `Transaction`, `EngineAPI`, `JSON-RPC`, `BeaconAPI`, `Internal`)
       - `bug_bounty_scope`: Is this boundary in-scope? (`in-scope`, `out-of-scope`, `conditional`)
       - `attacker_controlled`: Can an external attacker control data crossing this boundary? (`true`, `false`)

    3. **Document Assumptions**: For each boundary, explicitly state the trust assumptions. Examples:
       - "We trust the BLS signature verification to reject invalid attestations."
       - "We assume the Engine API is authenticated and not exposed to untrusted peers."
       - "Remote peers can send arbitrary data on P2P — all input must be validated."

    4. **Apply Ethereum-Specific STRIDE Threat Model**: For each identified trust boundary and interaction, systematically analyze potential threats using the Ethereum-adapted categories below:

       - **Spoofing (Peer/Validator Identity)**:
         - Can a remote peer forge ENR records or peer IDs on devp2p/libp2p?
         - Can an attacker impersonate a validator (e.g., publish attestations/proposals with a spoofed index)?
         - Can Engine API callers bypass JWT authentication?
         - Can an attacker replay signed messages from a different fork/epoch?

       - **Tampering (Block/State/Message Integrity)**:
         - Can P2P messages (blocks, attestations, blob sidecars) be modified in transit or at rest?
         - Can an attacker manipulate the state trie, receipts trie, or beacon state?
         - Can ENR records be poisoned to redirect peer discovery?
         - Can blob data or KZG commitments be corrupted without detection?
         - Can an attacker tamper with the fork choice store (justified/finalized checkpoints)?

       - **Repudiation (Slashable Offenses / Equivocation)**:
         - Can a validator produce a slashable offense (double vote, surround vote) that evades detection?
         - Can an attacker trigger equivocation in the node's own attestation/proposal logic?
         - Can slashing evidence be suppressed or discarded before inclusion?
         - Can block proposers selectively exclude slashing proofs?

       - **Information Disclosure (MEV / Timing / State Leaks)**:
         - Can pending transaction data leak to enable MEV extraction (front-running, sandwich attacks)?
         - Can timing side channels reveal validator key material or upcoming proposals?
         - Can peer list or validator assignment data be exfiltrated to enable targeted attacks?
         - Can pre-images of commitments (e.g., RANDAO reveals) be obtained early?

       - **Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion / Eclipse / Spam)**:
         - Can eclipse attacks isolate the node from honest peers?
         - Can blob spam (PeerDAS) or attestation flooding exhaust memory, CPU, or disk I/O?
         - Can a slow peer or slow loris connection starve the P2P worker pool?
         - Can malformed SSZ/RLP payloads cause excessive deserialization cost?
         - Can an attacker trigger excessive state recomputation (e.g., state transition replays)?
         - Can topic/subnet subscription be manipulated to cause gossip amplification?

       - **Elevation of Privilege (Consensus/Fork-choice Manipulation)**:
         - Can an attacker manipulate fork choice weights to force reorgs?
         - Can a minority proposer claim extra slots through timing games?
         - Can an attacker gain committee assignment advantages through grinding?
         - Can unauthorized actions be performed through the Engine API or Beacon API?
         - Can validator exit/withdrawal messages be forged or replayed?

  <phase_b title="Property Generation">
    Using the trust model from Phase A, generate formal properties. Work through each source below in order — do not skip any.

    1. **STRIDE Threat Properties** (from Phase A step 4): For each concrete threat identified in the Ethereum-specific STRIDE analysis, create a property that, if verified, would mitigate that threat. Each of the 6 STRIDE categories that produced threats in Phase A must yield at least one property. If a category produced no relevant threats for this subgraph, skip it — do not force irrelevant properties.

    2. **Trust Boundary Properties**: For each trust boundary identified in Phase A, formulate properties that must hold true for the boundary to be secure. **Prioritize boundaries marked as `in-scope` and `attacker_controlled: true`.**

    3. **Assumption Properties**: Convert each trust assumption into a formal property. Example: if an assumption is "only authenticated Engine API callers can trigger newPayload," the property would be `forall caller: engineAPI.newPayload(caller, payload) => caller.hasValidJWT == true`.

    4. **Invariant Properties**: Ensure every invariant identified in the subgraphs (from `.mmd` `note` blocks with `INV-NNN:` labels) is represented as a formal property.

    5. **State Transition Properties**: For critical state transitions, define precise pre-conditions that must be met before the transition and post-conditions that must be true after.

    6. **Optimization Correctness Properties**: When the specification describes an operation whose correctness is critical (verification, validation, proof checking, uniqueness enforcement), consider that implementations commonly cache, deduplicate, or precompute results for performance. For each such operation, generate a property asserting that any such optimization must preserve the original correctness guarantee — i.e., the optimized path must produce the same accept/reject decision as the unoptimized path for all inputs. Mark these as `type: "invariant"`, severity based on blast radius if violated.

    7. **Classify Reachability**: For each property, determine:
       - `entry_points`: List of entry points that can trigger this property (e.g., `["P2P", "EngineAPI"]`)
       - `attacker_controlled`: Can an external attacker control the inputs? (`true`/`false`)
       - `classification`: One of:
         - `external-reachable`: Reachable via in-scope external entry points
         - `internal-only`: Only reachable via internal calls
         - `api-only`: Only reachable via out-of-scope APIs (JSON-RPC, Beacon API)

    8. **Determine Bug Bounty Scope**: Based on reachability analysis:
       - `in-scope`: Property is reachable via in-scope entry points with attacker-controlled input
       - `out-of-scope`: Property is only reachable via out-of-scope entry points
       - `conditional`: Requires specific conditions or further investigation

    9. **Assign Severity**: Use the `severity_classification` from `bug_bounty_scope` as the **sole decision boundary**. For each property:
       - Ask: **"If this property is violated, what is the blast radius on the live network?"**
       - Start from INFORMATIONAL and escalate **only** when the violation's impact meets or exceeds the next level's `impact` threshold.
       - A correctness property (data format, type constraint, encoding rule) is INFORMATIONAL unless you can articulate a concrete attack path where violating it causes network-level impact (crashes, splits, slashing at the threshold %).
       - Do NOT inflate severity based on "importance to correctness" — severity is about **attacker-exploitable network impact**, not code criticality.

    10. **Determine Bug Bounty Eligibility**: A property is `bug_bounty_eligible: true` if:
       - `reachability.classification == "external-reachable"` AND
       - `reachability.bug_bounty_scope == "in-scope"` AND
       - `severity` is `MEDIUM` or higher

    11. **Assign IDs**: Assign a unique ID per property using the `_id_prefix` from the context data:
        - Use the `_id_prefix` field from the input context (e.g., `"PROP-txval"`)
        - Format: `{_id_prefix}-{type_abbrev}-{seq:03d}`
          - `type_abbrev`: `inv` (invariant), `pre` (pre-condition), `post` (post-condition), `asm` (assumption)
          - `seq`: 1-based sequence within this (prefix, type) combination
        - Example: `PROP-txval-inv-001`, `PROP-p2p-pre-003`
        - Fallback: If `_id_prefix` is not available, use `PROP-{hash8}-{type_abbrev}-{seq:03d}` where `hash8` is the first 8 chars of a hash of the source file path
  </phase_b>

  <severity_context>
    The `severity_classification` object inside `bug_bounty_scope` is the **sole decision boundary** for severity assignment.
    - Each level's `impact` field defines the minimum blast radius required. Severity is about **attacker-exploitable network impact**, not code criticality or "importance."
    - A property that enforces a data format constraint (e.g., fixed-length fields, type bounds) is INFORMATIONAL unless violating it leads to a concrete attack path with measurable network impact at the level's threshold.
    - If no `severity_classification` is present, default all properties to MEDIUM and flag for manual review.
  </severity_context>

    For each item processed, produce a result object. **Keep properties compact** — downstream phases only need the fields shown below.

    - [ ] All properties have `severity` (one of: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFORMATIONAL)
    - [ ] Severity assigned using `severity_classification.impact` thresholds, not intuitive importance — correctness-only properties without concrete network impact are INFORMATIONAL
