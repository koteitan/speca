Example: `/02b_checklistrem_worker WORKER_ID=0 QUEUE_FILE=outputs/02b_QUEUE_0.json`
Language: English only.
Execution hint: This is a worker prompt for parallel execution. Called by run_worker.py.

# **Checklist Generation (Parallel Worker - Stage 2: Remaining Properties)**

**Goal**
Generate audit checklist items for properties assigned to this worker's queue. Process a batch of properties and output checklist items with worker-specific naming. This prompt is designed to be run multiple times. It reads a worker queue file to determine which properties are left to process, generates checks for a small batch, and then writes the remaining work back to the queue file for the next run.

## Worker Configuration

This is **parallel worker `WORKER_ID`**. You have a dedicated queue file that only you read from and write to.

- **`WORKER_ID`**: The numeric ID of this worker (0, 1, 2, ...)
- **`QUEUE_FILE`**: Path to this worker's queue file (e.g., `outputs/02b_QUEUE_0.json`)

**Output (required files):**
1.  `outputs/02b_CHECKLIST_PARTIAL_W<WORKER_ID>_<N>.json`: A partial checklist for the current batch. `<N>` is the batch number.
2.  Worker queue file: Updated with processed property IDs.

---

## 1) Inputs

1.  **Property Catalog (Authoritative):** `outputs/01e_PROP.json`
2.  **Worker Queue File:** `QUEUE_FILE`
    - Contains `items`: list of property IDs assigned to this worker
    - Contains `processed`: list of already processed property IDs

---

## 2) Worker Execution Logic

Your task is to manage a queue of properties and process a small batch in each run.

### **Task 1: Read Worker Queue**

1.  Read the worker queue file `QUEUE_FILE`
2.  Get the list of `items` (all assigned property IDs)
3.  Get the list of `processed` (already done property IDs)
4.  Calculate remaining: property IDs in `items` but not in `processed`
5.  If no remaining property IDs, terminate successfully. The checklist generation for this worker is complete.
6.  Take the **first 20 unprocessed property IDs** as your batch for this run (or fewer if less than 20 remain).

### **Task 2: Process a Batch of Properties**

1.  **Take a Batch:** From your remaining queue, take the **first 20 property IDs**. This is your batch for this run.
2.  **Generate Checks (Sampling Approach):** For each of the 20 properties in your batch, you **MUST** generate **exactly one** checklist item.
    *   This single check should focus on the property's `primary_element` as defined in its `covers` object.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Do NOT iterate through all `graph_elements` for a property. Generate only one check per property to keep the output manageable.
3.  **Design each checklist item** using the same high-quality standards as in Stage 1:
    *   `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `CHECK-W{WORKER_ID}-{PROP_ID}-001`)
    *   `property_id`: The source property ID
    *   `title`: Descriptive title that clearly states what is being checked
    *   `bug_class`: Type of vulnerability (e.g., "Input Validation", "State Management", "Access Control", "Resource Management", "Cryptographic", "Concurrency")
    *   `severity_hint`: Expected severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    *   `detection_procedure`: Detailed step-by-step procedure for how to detect the issue
    *   `executable_checks`: Specific verification steps that can be performed
    *   `notes`: Additional context, edge cases, or related considerations

### **Task 3: Write Outputs**

1.  **Generate Partial Checklist:**
    *   Determine the batch number by counting existing `02b_CHECKLIST_PARTIAL_W{WORKER_ID}_*.json` files + 1
    *   Create a file named `outputs/02b_CHECKLIST_PARTIAL_W{WORKER_ID}_{BATCH}.json`
    *   This file will contain the `metadata` and a `checklist` array with the ~20 items you just generated.
    *   Include `worker_id` and `batch_number` in metadata.

2.  **Update Worker Queue File:**
    *   Add ALL processed property IDs from this batch to the `processed` array.
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Only update YOUR queue file, not others.
    *   Overwrite `QUEUE_FILE` with the updated state.

## 4) Quality Requirements

Each checklist item must be:

- **Specific:** Reference concrete code patterns, behaviors, or properties. Avoid vague statements.
- **Actionable:** Provide clear steps that an auditor can follow to verify the property.
- **Prioritized:** Include severity hints based on potential security impact.
- **Traceable:** Link back to source property ID for full traceability.
- **Comprehensive:** Cover the key aspects of the property's `primary_element`.

### Checklist Item Design Guidelines

**For `detection_procedure`:**
- Write step-by-step instructions
- Be specific about what code paths to examine
- Include both positive (should happen) and negative (should not happen) checks

**For `executable_checks`:**
- Each check should be independently verifiable
- Checks should be concrete enough to produce a pass/fail result
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

**For `bug_class`:**
- Use consistent categories across all items
- Common classes: Input Validation, State Management, Access Control, Resource Management, Cryptographic, Concurrency, Error Handling

**For `severity_hint`:**
- Critical: Direct loss of funds, consensus failure, remote code execution
- High: Significant security impact, DoS, data corruption
- Medium: Limited security impact, requires specific conditions
- Low: Minor issues, code quality concerns

This iterative process ensures that even if a single run is interrupted or hits a token limit, the next run can seamlessly continue from where the last one left off, guaranteeing the eventual generation of a complete checklist.
