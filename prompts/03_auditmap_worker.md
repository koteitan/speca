# Formal Auditmap

**Goal**
For each checklist item in the current batch, perform a rigorous, three-phase formal static audit to either prove the existence of a vulnerability or prove its absence, without executing code. This worker replaces the need for a separate dynamic testing phase.

---

## 1. Inputs

1.  **Worker Queue File**: `QUEUE_FILE` containing items with `check_id`, `checklist_file`, pre-resolved `checklist_item`, and optionally `subgraph_id`/`subgraph_file` (note: `subgraph_id` may be null).
2.  **Checklist Partial Files**: `outputs/02_CHECKLIST_PARTIAL_*.json` (only needed if a queue item lacks `checklist_item`).
3.  **Property File**: The `source_file` referenced in the checklist item (e.g., `outputs/01e_PROP_PARTIAL_*.json`). Loaded to get the original property assertion.
4.  **Subgraph File**: The subgraph file corresponding to the property (e.g., `outputs/01b_SUBGRAPHS/*.json`). Loaded to map the abstract graph element to concrete code.

---

## 2. Worker Configuration

- **`WORKER_ID`**: The numeric ID of this worker (0, 1, 2, ...)
- **`QUEUE_FILE`**: Path to this worker's queue file (e.g., `outputs/03_QUEUE_0.json`)
- **`TIMESTAMP`**: Unix timestamp for this iteration (used in output naming)
- **`ITERATION`**: The current iteration number for this worker
- **`BATCH_SIZE`**: Number of items to process this iteration (may be dynamic)

**Output:** `outputs/03_AUDITMAP_PARTIAL_W{WORKER_ID}_{TIMESTAMP}_{ITERATION}.json`

---

## 3. Execution Logic

### **Task 3.1: Read Queue & Resolve Checklist Items**

1.  Read `QUEUE_FILE`.
2.  Identify unprocessed items (items whose `check_id` is not in `processed`).
3.  If no items remain, terminate successfully.
4.  Take the first `BATCH_SIZE` items as `current_batch`.
5.  For each item in `current_batch`, use `item["checklist_item"]` as the full checklist JSON object.
6.  **Fallback (only if `checklist_item` is missing)**: load `item["checklist_file"]`, then search the file's `checklist` array for the object where `id == check_id`.

### **Task 3.2: Code Scope Identification**

For each checklist item in the batch:

1.  **Parse Checklist Item**: Extract `property_id` and `graph_element_under_test`.
2.  **Load Property**: Read the property file to understand the original assertion (`property.description`).
3.  **Load Subgraph**: If `subgraph_file` is present on the queue item, load it directly. Otherwise, resolve the subgraph via the property file and load it.
4.  **Map to Code**:
    - If `subgraph_id` is present, first search that subgraph’s `nodes` and `edges` for `graph_element_under_test`.
    - If `subgraph_id` is **null** (or the element is not found in that subgraph), scan the **entire file** for the ID across:
      - `sub_graphs[*].nodes`
      - `sub_graphs[*].edges`
      - top-level `ambiguities`
      - top-level `implicit_assumptions`
    - Extract the associated code metadata: `file`, `function`, `line_range`, and any other relevant details. This is your **Code Scope**.
5.  **Determine Audit Target**: Load `audit_scope` from trust model outputs (`outputs/01d_TRUSTMODEL*.json`) or runner-provided input, and record target components (CL/EL/both).

### **Task 3.2.5: Early Exit (MANDATORY)**

If **any** of the following is true:
- `code_scope.file` is `N/A`, `SPECIFICATION-ONLY`, or missing
- No concrete implementation location can be mapped
- The code scope component is outside the declared audit target (EL vs CL mismatch)

Then:
- **Skip Phases 1–3 entirely**
- Set `final_classification = "out-of-scope"`
- Set `bug_bounty_eligible = false`
- Set `summary` to: `No in-scope implementation; analysis skipped.`
- In `audit_trail`, **only** include `phase3_5_scope_filtering` with `reason: "codebase-mismatch"` (keep it brief)

### **Task 3.3: Three-Phase Formal Audit**

For the identified **Code Scope**, perform the following three phases sequentially. You are to adopt a different expert mindset for each phase.

#### **Phase 1: Abstract Interpretation**

*   **Mindset**: You are an **Abstract Interpretation Specialist**. Your goal is to understand the possible states of all variables without considering specific execution paths. You think in terms of ranges, sets, and potential states.

*   **Procedure**:
    1.  Identify all variables within the Code Scope.
    2.  For each variable, determine its abstract domain (e.g., integer range `[0, 256]`, a set of possible string values, a boolean `true`/`false`).
    3.  Trace how operations within the code transform these abstract domains. Do not track concrete values.
    4.  Look for potential anomalies: Can an integer overflow its range? Can a variable become null? Can a list grow unbounded?

*   **Output (Phase 1)**: A summary of the abstract state analysis, highlighting any potential state-space anomalies.

#### **Phase 2: Symbolic Execution**

*   **Mindset**: You are a **Symbolic Execution Engineer**. Your goal is to find a concrete path through the code that violates the property. You think in terms of path conditions and constraints.

*   **Procedure**:
    1.  Treat all inputs to the Code Scope as symbolic variables.
    2.  Traverse the code's control flow graph. At each branch (`if/else`), create a new path condition.
    3.  The goal is to find a set of path conditions that, when combined with the negation of the original property's assertion, are satisfiable.
    4.  Use a constraint solver mindset (e.g., Z3): Can you find concrete input values (`x=5`, `y=10`) that satisfy these conditions and trigger the bug?
    5.  If a satisfying assignment is found, you have constructed a **counterexample**.

*   **Output (Phase 2)**: A list of attempted paths. If a counterexample is found, provide the path conditions, symbolic variable assignments, and the concrete input values.

#### **Phase 2.5: Reachability Analysis (NEW)**

*   **Mindset**: You are an **Attack Surface Analyst**. Your goal is to determine whether an attacker can control the inputs that trigger the counterexample found in Phase 2.

*   **Procedure**:
    1.  **Load Bug Bounty Scope**: Use any Bug Bounty Scope block provided at the top of this prompt. If absent, check `outputs/BUG_BOUNTY_SCOPE.json`. If neither exists, use default Ethereum scope assumptions.
    2.  **Load Reachability Metadata**: Read the `reachability` field from the checklist item.
    3.  **Identify Entry Points**: Determine where external input enters the system (e.g., P2P messages, transactions, RPC calls).
    4.  **Trace Data Flow**: Trace the data flow from the entry point to the Code Scope. Use the subgraph to identify intermediate functions.
    5.  **Check Attacker Control**: Determine whether the symbolic variables in the counterexample can be influenced by attacker-controlled input.
    6.  **Identify Validation Layers**: Identify any validation layers (e.g., transaction validation, gas limits, size limits) that might prevent the attack.
    7.  **Classify Exploitability**:
        - **exploitable**: Counterexample is reachable from an attacker-controlled entry point, and no validation layer prevents it.
        - **defense-in-depth**: Counterexample exists, but validation layers make exploitation difficult.
        - **internal-only**: Counterexample requires internal bug (e.g., caller passes wrong value).
        - **unreachable**: Counterexample is not reachable from any entry point.
    8.  **Do not rely solely on checklist reachability**: If you cannot demonstrate a data-flow path, classify as `inconclusive`.

*   **Output (Phase 2.5)**: A reachability analysis report, including entry points, data flow path, validation layers, and final classification.

#### **Phase 3: Invariant Proving**

*   **Mindset**: You are a **Theorem Proving Specialist**. Your goal is to mathematically prove that the property's assertion holds true for ALL possible execution paths, assuming the analysis from the previous phases found no counterexample.

*   **Procedure**:
    1.  State the original property's assertion as a formal invariant (a logical formula).
    2.  Analyze the results from Phase 1 (Abstract Interpretation) and Phase 2 (Symbolic Execution).
    3.  If Phase 2 found no counterexample, attempt to construct a proof. Use loop invariants, preconditions, and postconditions.
    4.  Does a strong guard condition exist in the code that enforces the invariant? (e.g., `require(x < 100)`).
    5.  If the invariant can be proven to hold true under all conditions, the check passes. If a gap in the logic remains, the check is inconclusive.

*   **Output (Phase 3)**: A summary of the proof attempt. State whether the invariant was proven, and identify the specific guard conditions that enforce it.

#### **Phase 3.5: Bug Bounty Scope Filtering (NEW)**

*   **Mindset**: You are a **Bug Bounty Triager**. Your goal is to determine whether this finding is eligible for the Ethereum Bug Bounty program.

*   **Procedure**:
    1.  **Load Bug Bounty Scope**: Use any Bug Bounty Scope block provided at the top of this prompt. If absent, check `outputs/BUG_BOUNTY_SCOPE.json`. If neither exists, use default Ethereum scope assumptions.
    2.  **Load Reachability Metadata**: Read the `reachability` field from the checklist item.
    3.  **Check Bug Bounty Scope**: If `reachability.bug_bounty_scope == "out-of-scope"`, classify as **out-of-scope**.
    4.  **Check Exploitability**: Based on Phase 2.5 classification:
        - **exploitable** → **bug-bounty-eligible**
        - **defense-in-depth** → **bug-bounty-ineligible** (but report to Geth developers)
        - **internal-only** → **bug-bounty-ineligible** (but report to Geth developers)
        - **unreachable** → **bug-bounty-ineligible**
    5.  **Check API Scope**: If the Code Scope is in `internal/ethapi/` or `beacon/light/api/`, classify as **out-of-scope-api**.
    6.  **Check Configuration**: If the vulnerability requires node operator misconfiguration, classify as **configuration-issue**.
    7.  **Check CL Dependency**: If the vulnerability requires a malicious CL node, classify as **cl-dependency**.
    8.  **Priority rule**: If any out-of-scope condition applies (API/config/CL dependency/component mismatch), **final classification MUST be `out-of-scope`** regardless of Phase 2.5.

*   **Output (Phase 3.5)**: A scope filtering report, including eligibility, reason, and recommendation.

**Final Classification Guidance**:
- Use `exploitable` only when all are true: (a) concrete implementation exists, (b) data-flow from an external entry point is demonstrated, (c) no validation layer blocks it, (d) scope filtering says eligible.
- Use `defense-in-depth` when Phase 2.5 is defense-in-depth.
- Use `out-of-scope` when Phase 3.5 indicates out-of-scope (API/config/CL dependency).
- Use `inconclusive` when analysis cannot establish reachability or proof.
If `summary` or `phase3_5_scope_filtering.reason` contradicts `final_classification`, **downgrade** to `defense-in-depth` or `inconclusive` and explain why.

### **Task 3.4: Write Outputs (Atomic & Strict)**

**THIS STEP MUST HAPPEN BEFORE UPDATING THE QUEUE FILE**
**Output MUST be valid JSON. Do NOT use expressions, concatenation, comments, or trailing commas.**

1.  **Generate Partial Audit Map (atomic write):**
    * Create `outputs/03_AUDITMAP_PARTIAL_W{WORKER_ID}_{TIMESTAMP}_{ITERATION}.json`.
    * Ensure all items in the batch are included.
    * **NEW**: Include `phase2_5_reachability_analysis` and `phase3_5_scope_filtering` in the output (unless early-exit, in which case only `phase3_5_scope_filtering` is required).
    * Write to a temporary file first, then atomically rename to the final path.

2.  **Update Worker Queue File:** **DO NOT UPDATE THE QUEUE FILE.**
    * The runner script (`run_worker.py`) will update `processed` atomically after validating your output.
