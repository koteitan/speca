"""Pydantic models for the NDJSON pipeline events emitted by
``run_phase.py --json``.

These models are the **single source of truth** for the wire shape of every
event the orchestrator emits. The TypeScript CLI consumes JSON Schemas
generated from these classes (via ``scripts/export_schemas.py``) and
auto-derives a Zod parser, so a Pydantic-side rename surfaces as a CLI
build error rather than silent runtime drift.

See ``docs/SPECA_CLI_SPEC.md`` §8.2 / §12.1 for the event taxonomy.
