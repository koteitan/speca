"""HTTP routes for the Findings API.

Two endpoints:

* ``GET /api/runs/<run_id>/findings`` — list, with optional
  ``?phase=&severity=&verdict=`` filters.
* ``GET /api/runs/<run_id>/findings/<property_id>`` — single record or 404.

v0 reads from the global ``outputs/`` directory (see
``finding_loader.load_findings``) and stamps ``meta.data_source =
"current_outputs"`` so the SPA can render an explanatory banner. Per-run
isolation arrives in v1.
