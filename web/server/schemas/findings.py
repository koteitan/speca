"""Pydantic schemas for the Findings API.

These models describe the *normalized* shape returned by the
``GET /api/runs/<id>/findings`` endpoints, as designed in
``docs/UI_DESIGN.md`` Section 7.4. Normalization itself lives in
:mod:`web.server.services.finding_normalizer`; this module only declares
the wire shape.

The schema is intentionally lenient on the boundary:

* ``verdict`` is kept as a free-form string. Phase 04 verdicts use a closed
  set (``CONFIRMED_VULNERABILITY`` etc.) but forks may add new ones, so we
  validate severity strictly and verdict softly. The frontend ``VerdictChip``
  decides how to render unknown verdicts.
* ``critique`` / ``related_past_fixes`` are placeholders for v3 (Phase 05).
  The keys are present so the frontend can rely on the field existing;
  v0 always returns ``None`` / ``[]``.
