"""Load + merge Phase 03/04 PARTIAL JSON files into ``Finding`` records.

This is the Python sibling of ``cli/src/lib/findings/loader.ts``. The
contract differs slightly:

* The CLI uses the in-place CWD plus an arbitrary glob argument; the web
  backend always reads from :data:`web.server.config.SPECA_OUTPUTS_DIR`
  recursively (including subdirectories like ``outputs/test-litecoin/``).
* The CLI emits a flat-but-rich ``Finding`` (proof_trace, attack_scenario,
  classification, ...); the web backend emits the slimmer
  :class:`web.server.schemas.findings.Finding` matching ``UI_DESIGN.md``
  Section 7.4.
* Dedup policy differs: the CLI was "first-write wins, later phases
  override specific fields". The web v0 needs *Phase 04 wins over Phase 03*
  when both carry the same ``property_id``, with timestamp as tie-breaker.

v0 is intentionally a "global outputs/" reader. Per-run isolation
(per ``.speca/runs/<id>/outputs``) is v1 — until then the ``run_id`` path
param is accepted but ignored, and the response carries
``meta.data_source = "current_outputs"`` so the UI can banner the caveat.
